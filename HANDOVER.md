# Beamline Tank: handover

A LaserTank-style puzzle game (turn-based tank, lasers, mirrors, crates, anti-tanks). It runs as a single-file web page and as an installable PWA for phones. It uses no frameworks or dependencies, and every level is checked by a solver.

- **Live game (GitHub Pages):** https://coshea321.github.io/ubiquitous-memory/ (served from `docs/` on `main`, so every merge goes live)
- **Status:** version 1.3, 48 levels, ordered easy to hard. Sectors 29–48 are an extra-hard tier (par 80–174, sorted by par). Tap-to-drive, tap-to-shoot, undo, restart, progress saved on the device, light and dark themes.
- **Name:** "Beamline Tank" is deliberately not "LaserTank". The artwork and levels are original; only the rules are borrowed.

## Quick start

```bash
npm run build     # solve all levels, bake in PAR, write docs/ (PWA) and build/artifact.html
npm run solve     # print par + shortest solution for every level (or: npm run solve -- crate)
npm run serve     # serve docs/ on http://localhost:8080
npm run check     # headless smoke test of the PWA (needs Playwright: preinstalled in Claude Code web sessions, else npm i -D playwright)
```

Node 18+ is enough. Nothing needs installing except Playwright for `check`.

## Version number

The header shows a small version number (`v1.3`). It comes from `version` in `package.json`, which the build writes into the page.
Bump it in every PR that players will notice: the second number for new levels or features (1.1 → 1.2), the first for a big change (1.x → 2.0).
The service worker cache is separate: the build still stamps it from a hash of the page, so phones update whether or not the version moves.

## File map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/engine.js` | Pure game rules. No DOM. Shared by the browser and the Node tools. |
| `src/levels.js` | `LEVELS` array (`{name, tip, rows}`), plus `ORIG_NAMES` (used only to migrate old saved progress). |
| `src/ui.js` | Canvas rendering, input, animation, tap-to-drive routing, save/load. |
| `src/shell.html` | Title, fonts, CSS tokens, markup. It has no `<html>/<head>` because the artifact host adds those. |
| `pwa/` | Manifest, service-worker template, icons. Copied into `docs/` by the build. |
| `tools/build.js` | Assembles everything. Fails the build if any level is unsolvable. |
| `tools/lib.js` | Loads engine + levels into Node; BFS `solve(rows)`. |
| `tools/solve.js`, `tools/try.js` | Check the real levels, or a scratch file of candidates. |
| `tools/gen.js`, `prune.js`, `pick.js` | Random level generator → declutter → rank. Produced sectors 21–28. |
| `tools/climb.js` | Hill-climber: mutates a level cell by cell, keeping changes that stay solvable and raise par. Produced the extra-hard tier: remixes of earlier levels, plus five levels climbed from fresh `gen.js` layouts (Tidewater, Narrows, Chicane, Sentry Post, Cold Front), then `prune.js`. |
| `tools/batch.js` | One command for a batch of new extra-hard levels from scratch: gen → climb → prune → reject near-copies → name → insert by par. See below. |
| `tools/check.js` | Playwright smoke test (script errors, service worker, offline reload, tap-to-drive, tap-to-shoot, collapsible sector strip and its groups, level switch mid-animation). |
| `docs/` | **Build output.** The deployable PWA. Do not edit by hand. |
| `build/artifact.html` | **Build output.** Paste or publish as the claude.ai artifact. |
| `BACKLOG.md` | Pending ideas and decisions on record. |
| `.github/` | PR template and the CI checks (build, build output committed, smoke test). |
| `.claude/skills/release/` | `/release`: the solve → build → check → commit → push → PR sequence. |

## Level format

Each level is an array of equal-length strings, one character per cell. Sizes vary; the board scales to fit.

```
#  wall          b  brick (one shot)     B  crate (push; in water → bridge)
.  floor         G  glass (laser passes, tank can't)
~  water         i  ice      t  thin ice (becomes water after you leave it)
F  flag (goal)   T  tank start (faces up)
u r d l  conveyor belt (moves the tank only)
X Y Z    tunnel pairs (two of the same letter)
1 2 3 4  mirror, open sides: 1=up+right 2=right+down 3=down+left 4=left+up
5 6 7 8  rotary mirror, same orientations as 1–4 (spins clockwise when hit on a dull side)
^ > v <  anti-tank facing that way
```

A mirror's open sides are the two faces its bright diagonal looks out of. A beam entering through an open side turns toward the other open side. A beam hitting a dull side pushes the mirror, or spins it if it is a rotary mirror.

## Rules as implemented (`src/engine.js`)

- Actions: `0 1 2 3` = up, right, down, left; `4` = fire. Pressing a direction the tank isn't facing only turns it (this still counts as a move).
- **Laser:** travels from the tank and passes over terrain and glass.
  - Bricks are destroyed.
  - Crates, mirrors and dead anti-tanks are pushed one square.
  - A live anti-tank dies only when hit on its muzzle; a hit from any other side pushes it.
  - A beam that comes back to the tank kills it.
- **Pushed objects:** they slide over ice and thin ice and pass through tunnels if the exit is clear. A crate that lands in water becomes a bridge (`=`); anything else pushed into water sinks. Objects can't enter the flag square.
- **Anti-tanks:** they fire the moment the tank is on their barrel line with nothing in between. Glass doesn't block them. This is checked after every single tank step, so it also catches the tank mid-slide or mid-belt.
- **Rules I chose where I wasn't sure of the original game.** These may differ from classic LaserTank:
  - Dead anti-tanks can still be pushed.
  - Anti-tanks see through glass.
  - Anti-tank shots don't bounce off mirrors.
  - Belts don't move objects.
  - Thin ice ignores objects passing over it.
- `act(state, action, frames)` mutates `state`. When `frames` is an array, it receives a snapshot after each atomic change (with `laser` points on beam frames), and the UI plays these back as animation. The solver passes `null`.

**If you change a rule, run `npm run solve` afterwards.** Every level's solvability and par depend on these rules.

## UI notes (`src/ui.js`)

- **Colors:** every color is a CSS token in `shell.html`. The canvas reads the tokens through `getComputedStyle` and re-reads them when the theme changes.
- **Sector strip:** a `<details>` above the board, collapsed by default. Its summary shows the current sector and how many are cleared; picking a sector closes it again.
  Past 20 levels it shows 20 sectors at a time, with a tab per group (`01–20`, `21–40`, …) and a cleared count on each tab. It opens on the current level's group (`GROUP` in `ui.js`).
- **Tap-to-drive:** `route()` runs a breadth-first search using only the four drive actions on cloned states. It therefore respects ice, belts, tunnels and anti-tank fire. It gives up after 40k states. Tapping the tank fires.
- **Tap-to-shoot:** if the tapped square can't be reached but holds an object, `aim()` tries a shot in each direction (the current facing first, then clockwise) on cloned states. It picks the first shot whose beam reaches that square, changes something, and doesn't destroy the tank. Mirror bounces count. That becomes turn + fire, or just fire. If neither driving nor shooting works, it shows a red cross.
- **Input queue:** tapped routes go into `queue`. Pressing a key or button replaces the queue, which interrupts an auto-drive.
- **Saved progress:** stored in `localStorage` key `blt2` as solved level *names*, plus the current level by name (`n`, with its index `li` as a fallback), so levels can be reordered freely.
- **Artifact leftovers:** `window.claude.hot` calls are for the artifact host and are no-ops in the PWA.

## Adding or changing levels

1. Sketch candidates in `scratch.js` (`module.exports=[{name,rows}]`) and run `node tools/try.js ./scratch.js`.
2. Read the printed solution (`U R D L F`) to spot unintended shortcuts. If one exists, add walls, water or glass to close it and re-run.
3. Add the level to `src/levels.js` at the right difficulty position, with a one-line `tip`.
4. Run `npm run build`.

Par is the minimum number of actions, turns included, so it is a rough difficulty signal. The `states` count from `try.js` is a second one.

To get more hard levels from the generator:

```bash
node tools/gen.js 7 50000 mix > a.jsonl     # themes: mix | at (anti-tank heavy) | ice
cat a.jsonl | node tools/pick.js 10 > picked.jsonl
```

For an extra-hard level, hill-climb an existing hard one (about 200 iterations, roughly 15 minutes), then prune it:

```bash
node tools/climb.js 7 200 '["#####",...]' best.json
```

Generated levels are valid but look random. Hand-made levels read better.

### Many levels in one go (`tools/batch.js`)

```bash
node tools/batch.js 10 7        # 10 new extra-hard levels, seed 7 (use a new seed each run)
npm run build && npm run check  # then /release
```

It needs no judgement calls, so a cheaper model can run it. It does the whole pipeline: random layouts (`gen.js`) → hill-climb (`climb.js`) → `prune.js`.
It keeps a level only if par ≥ 100 and no existing level is within 20 squares of it under any rotation or mirror. It names it and slots it into sectors 29+ by par.
About 8 levels an hour on 4 CPUs. Progress is written to `src/levels.js` after every round, so commit after each run: a cloud container can be reclaimed when idle.
Keep each PR to about 10 levels so it stays reviewable.

## Put it on your phone (PWA)

A PWA needs to be served over HTTPS. The simplest free option is GitHub Pages.

1. Create a GitHub repository and push this folder to it. It is already a git repository.
2. On GitHub, go to Settings → Pages. Under Build and deployment, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select branch `main` and folder `/docs`, then save.
3. After a minute the game is live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.
4. Install it:
   - **Android (Chrome):** open the URL, then ⋮ → **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen**).
   - **iPhone (Safari):** open the URL, then Share → **Add to Home Screen**.

After that it opens full screen and works offline. The service worker caches the page, icons and fonts. Each build stamps a new cache version, so after you push an update the phone picks it up the next time the app opens with a connection.

Netlify or Cloudflare Pages also work: point them at the `docs` folder, with no build command.

## Test builds and the old artifact

The live game is GitHub Pages; merging to `main` deploys it. `build/artifact.html` is still built: each PR publishes it as a separate test artifact so the change can be tried before merge. The original claude.ai artifact (https://claude.ai/artifact/81MKYyjjK6y3if68uSxwak) is retired and no longer updated.
